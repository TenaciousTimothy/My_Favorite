        <p>Welcome to my fanpage. </p>
        <p>Here you can find some information about my favorite artist : Eminem</p>

        <p>I really like Eminem as a rapper because of his old music and some of his new music of him just going ham.</p>
        <p>his flows are always clean </p>
        <p>and he doesnt go crazy with the autotune which is refreshing</p>
